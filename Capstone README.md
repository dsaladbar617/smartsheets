#### <strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</strong>
>I need a user friendly way to manage inventory, which promotes accountability and increases efficiency across the Air Force.

#### <strong>BACKSTORY:</strong>
> Aircraft maintenance is centered around sortie generation. It is the job of the maintainers to keep the aircraft in working condition so the pilots can conduct their missions.

> Aircraft maintenance often involves ordering parts for a job and those parts come in piecemeal; once all parts are on hand, we can conduct the maintenance action requiring those parts.  The downtime between receiving individual parts can be days, weeks, or months.  There is a lot of in-and-out in a parts cage at a maintenance squadron and parts frequently get misplaced.  To remedy this, I decided to create an Access database to better track parts received from supply, placed in our parts cage, and were awaiting maintenance actions, and those parts removed from the parts cage for installation on an aircraft.

> From there, the idea of incorporating QR codes into parts entered into the parts cage presented itself.  The idea being that any part large enough to fit a QR code could be so outfitted, with that QR containing all parts ordering information for the part in question to better enable personnel down range or at a different base to order parts before the arrival of a Maintenance Recovery Team (MRT).  This serves to cut down on "dead time" between the MRT arrival at the broken aircraft and the delivery of required parts; by the time the MRT gets on location, the needed parts are already ordered and on their way.
